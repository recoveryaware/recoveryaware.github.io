You can bandage the bleeding with food, with alcohol, with drugs, with work, with cigarettes, with sex; but eventually it will all ooze through and stain your life.

<blockquote><p>a lot of people make it seem like recovery is a step by step thing but they never talk about the relapses and the fact that recovery (emotional, mental, any kind) is a roller coaster that doesn’t work that way, some days you’re going to feel like you’re completely well and you’ll feel like you were never hurt in the first place, but other days it’ll seem like you never recovered at all. The point is, recovery isn’t linear, you’re going to fall back and spring forward. It’s okay to <i>not </i>be okay. And one day, you will be. </p></blockquote>

<p>there’s such an unhealthy stigma, especially in academic communities, surrounding taking time off or dropping out. putting education above your health and well-being isn’t okay and should not be the standard. obviously there are positives to school/college/uni, but the environment created by the education system can be so horrifically damaging in so many ways, and demonising stepping away from or leaving it only makes it worse. as much as education is important, your health and well-being are infinitely more so. </p>
<p>it is okay to take breaks. it’s okay to take a year off. it’s okay to leave if that’s what you need to do. dropping out does not make you stupid, nor does it make you a failure. take care of yourself first and foremost. traditional education is not the only way to learn.</p>

It constantly seems like you&rsquo;re lazy or like you&rsquo;re losing your mind, and it feels like your body is betraying you over nothing. </p><p>I want to play games with my family. I want to be able to sit at the table with them and pay attention to the conversations, but my head feels full of cotton and my eyes burn like I&rsquo;ve pulled two all-nighters and all I can manage is to lay on the couch in close proximity to them as they go about their activities. I don&rsquo;t have an answer for them when they ask me why I&rsquo;m so tired other than, apparently it&rsquo;s a flare day. </p><p>Sitting up in a chair is too much for me right now, how upsetting is that? The effort it would take to do so is beyond me and the only thing I want is to be able to sleep for a month.</p><p>Exercising would make this flare worse and I wouldn&rsquo;t have even been able to sit with my family for as long as I did. Going to bed at 7pm isn&rsquo;t going to change the fact that my body cannot recouperate like everyone else&rsquo;s. It does not matter how much or how little sleep I get, my body is different.

<blockquote>
<p>nobody is irrelevant. nobody is invisible. your neighbors know your name and see you set off to school or work or the backyard everyday, sometimes with a spring in your step and sometimes with hunched over shoulders. there was this one time some stranger pointed you out to their friends and said “that’s the haircut I want” or “I have that shirt, too” or “they go to my school”. someone has admired the way you carry yourself or gave a presentation or even the way you’re so polite when you first meet a person. you’ve made comments or jokes that have stuck in minds of overhearers and eavesdroppers. when old classmates of yours think back to kindergarten or fourth grade or sophomore year they remember you and have an opinion of you. you’ve made recommendations of songs and restaurants and even cookie brands and actually introduced people to their all-time favorites. the cashier at the grocery store knows exactly what laundry detergent your household uses, or even if you don’t do your laundry at all.</p>
<p>you can never be irrelevant. there’s pieces of you everywhere, in a dozen lives, in a hundred dreams, in a million memories. maybe it’s true that you don’t have any friends, and you have a sucky relationship with your family or no family at all and no-one ever checks up on you, and you’re really very lonely, but that doesn’t determine your worth. you do. and so do the billions of small attributions you’ve already made to the world, both long-term and short-term. so thank you.</p>

<blockquote><p>maybe i’m just projecting but i think there’s an inherent loneliness in living with a severe mental illness that makes you feel permanently estranged from others and long for the kind of connection where you feel completely understood and accepted, all while knowing other people have their own stuff to deal with or are just not equipped to ride out the worst of the illness with you. this leads to downplaying and/or hiding your symptoms as best you can, which takes even more of a psychological toll on you. this leads to not feeling loved as a complete person, and maybe not recognizing that love when it <i>is </i>present, or always fearing the day people have had enough and leave. even more so if this has already happened to you. it’s so exhausting and sad<br/></p></blockquote>

<p>keeping a child in condition where they don’t know if they’ll be safe today is torture.</p>
<p>keeping a child not knowing if they’re going to face a normal day or a day of screaming, tantrums and abuse you throw at them is torture.</p>
<p>keeping a child aware you can and intend to humiliate, hit, insult and scream at the moment they don’t do as they’re told to is torture.</p>
<p>keeping a child aware you’re building up their hatred towards them and waiting for a perfect moment to take it all out on them is torture.</p>
<p>threatening your child and keeping them terrified of how badly you could hurt them is torture, the longer it goes on, the bigger the psychological toll on the child.</p>
<p>letting your child know that their shelter, food, and permission to live is hanging by a thin thread and it can break any time, with any mistake they make, is torture.</p>
<p>keeping a child in condition where their every action, word, face expression or emotion could cause an avalanche of hatred and pain, accusations and blame on them, where their anxiety rises with every time they express, is torture.</p>
<p>having your child feel like they don’t deserve to be loved or comforted or paid attention to is torture.</p>
<p>having your child feel like they have to exhaust every last bit of their energy just to deserve to be alive is torture.</p>
<p>having your child feel like wanting for anything but the mere minimum they need for survival is selfish and makes them a burden is torture</p>
<p>having your child feel like their every need and want is a burden is torture.</p>
<p>having your child feel like they’ll never be good enough is torture.</p>
<p><i>stop torturing your children for convenience. your children are human beings. they do not exist for you, and they’re not your property. they’re not to be controlled by fear and guilt. 
<p><i> no child has deserved this.</i></p>
<p>damage you’re causing can never be paid back. you will always be guilty of torturing a child. you will always be a monster.</i></p></p>

<li>I should have beaten you more<br/></li>

<li>You deserved this pain<br/></li>
<li>You deserved even worse<br/></li>
<li>You’re weak<br/></li>
<li>Nobody cares what you want<br/></li>
<li>Do you think I get what I want?<br/></li>
<li>You’re useless<br/></li>
<li>Why do we even keep you around<br/></li>
<li>Why do we feed you<br/></li>
<li>Who do you think paid for all this<br/></li>
<li>You only take and take and give nothing back<br/></li>
<li>When will you start paying off<br/></li>
</ul><p>also:</p>
<ul><li>any kind of comparison to monsters, demons and pests<br/></li>
<li>any kind of insults or slurs related to appearance, gender or sexual
orientation<br/></li>
<li>life-threats or violence-threats, even when they don’t sound serious<br/></li>
<li>convincing children that their boundaries are a problem that needs to be
gotten rid of<br/></li>
<li>openly telling children everything that’s going on is their fault<br/></li>
</ul><p>if you feel the need to say these to your children, you obviously have no
love or care for them. You think your children should suffer and you see
nothing wrong with hurting your own child. You’re a disgrace and a burden on
your own child. Children deserve better than this. They deserve parents who
love them and protect them from pain. Why would you inflict pain on your own
child. You are abusive monsters. If a child is suffering because of you,
there’s nothing good about your existence.</p>

You know your life won’t wait for you, and you know that it is your responsibility to find what’s in store for you. But that doesn’t mean you any less scared. Any less lost.</p><p>I’m here to tell you that it’s okay. I’m here to tell you to stand up for who you want to be. Those big decisions that you have to make? Go with your gut. Never ignore your intuition, it will never fail you. Sometimes there are things that your heart knows and your mind can never explain.</p><p>Do what you love. You never have to apologize for doing things that you know can make you happy. Not everyone will think the same way you think, but it doesn’t matter. Listen to what your heart is telling you.</p><p>It is never too late for anyone. If an opportunity doesn’t exist, create it. If an idea doesn’t exist, create it. Self doubt will be your worst downfall. Everything begins and ends in your mind. Breathe in the future and breathe out the past. </p><p>If something makes you nervous, it’s worth doing. Don’t spend any more time thinking about it. You will never find happiness exclusively from other people. It must always start by being happy with your own self. Figure out exactly what you want and don’t stop until you get it. It will never be too late for you. It’s never too late.</p></blockquote>

Men who treat you like crap, don’t reciprocate your feelings, leave you feeling confused about your situation are not attractive. Please value yourself. </p></blockquote>

I&rsquo;m tired of the days where self hatred reigns. I&rsquo;m tired of having to explain to nurses and doctors why I do things to hurt myself, especially when my only explanation is I don&rsquo;t like myself. Nothing happened, I just wanted to hurt my liver. Nothing happened, I just wanted my body to feel like my brain. Nothing happened. I just don&rsquo;t like myself and, no, I have no real reason why to my knowledge. I know they say I&rsquo;m a good person and the future could hold a lot for me but it&rsquo;s as though I either don&rsquo;t believe it or sometimes just don&rsquo;t care. And I don&rsquo;t know that the medications are helping, and I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re making it worse. I just know I&rsquo;m so so tired of all of it, especially the past couple months which feel like they&rsquo;ve come from hell.</p></blockquote>

till the blade slit through my skin. Painful or not, they have stayed with me
longer than some people in my life have.</p><p><i>My eating disorder, </i>it taught me true discipline. It showed me how
people really see me. It gave me a reason to change, to be worth it, to be
enough. To reach everyone’s expectations. To be the first choice. Hungry? Think
of the reward at the end. Painful? What isn’t though. Beauty has a price.</p><p><i>My depression, </i>it taught me to stay away from people, they are all
the same, harmful. Taught me to live on my own, not be dependent. Sure, it hurts
to be lonely, but rather alone than surrounded by snakes. Isolation. Focusing
on myself.</p><p>And through all this, I’m still here. Standing. And they say people
with mental illnesses are weak. How are we weak if we’ve gone through the worst
of hell and still manage to be here; alive. All these tests, to prove how
strong we are, not together but alone. </p><p>Because in the end, we are 
all on our own. </p><p>Fighting for ourselves.</p><p>So keep your head up high, you may not be the ‘normal’ but you
are  strong. </p><p>Stay safe &amp; stay strong lovelies.</p><p><br/></p><h2><i><strike>P.S. and always

<p>It was life-changing for me when someone said that all coping mechanisms were necessary at some point and came from a place of survival. Behaviours that hurt you now at some point probably saved your life, because they helped you get through unimaginable trauma or symptoms, or because they helped you survive in an environment that wasn’t safe, or they helped you protect yourself against someone. Self-harm, disordered eating, and other trauma responses aren’t stupid or selfish, they’re your body trying to protect you with love, the best way it knows how. </p>
<p>That’s why it’s so tough to break those habits and patterns, you can’t hate your way out of them. It’s been really helpful for me to reframe triggers and urges that way, instead of saying “you’re an adult you shouldn’t still be feeling like this, you’re stupid and immature for still wanting to self-harm” </p>
<p>I’m trying to say things like </p>
<p>“I appreciate the strength it took to learn this tool, I know it helped for a long time and it came from a place of love, but now it’s not helpful and we’re going to do something else because now I’m in a new situation and I have new and better tools.” (like journaling, playing music, talking to friends, going for a walk, listening to loud music)</p>

<p>Self harm doesn’t always happen when a blade touches skin.</p>
<p>It’s skipping meals because you don’t feel like you deserve to eat today. It’s having sex because you want to be used or abused or defiled. It’s drinking recklessly because you might have the ‘courage’ do something stupid. It’s smoking - not because you need the nicotine - because you know it’s bad for you. It’s banging your head against a wall when you’re angry. It’s crossing the road without looking because you lowkey hope a car might hit you. It’s thinking about all the ways you could break a bone and make it look like an accident. It’s not taking painkillers because you want to suffer. It’s taking painkillers in excess because you know it’s dangerous. It’s walking home the more dangerous way because you’re kind of half hoping you’ll get attacked or raped or stabbed. It’s going for long walks at night and getting chilled to the bone and hoping that you get lost so that you can’t find your way back. It’s seeking out triggering material. It’s all the stupid little ways you punish yourself for existing.</p>
<p>Sometimes self harm happens when you put effort into depriving yourself of things you like or need, and sometimes it happens when you don’t put any effort into doing the things you like or need.</p>
<p>It’s a pattern of self-destructive behaviour, and it doesn’t only happen in one way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in DBT we learned that this sort of behavior is classified as “para-suicidal” ?? It’s putting yourself in a situation of danger or destruction with the intention of risking your safety rather than a direct attempt on your life. Kind of, leaving it all to chance? Also doing things to harm yourself or your self worth because you feel you deserve to feel the outcome of those actions. Hadn’t realized I’ve been living like this for over 10 years.</p>

<blockquote><p>Suicide feels like a sleeping monster inside me.<br/>
Every once in a while when things get really hard it wakes up and tries to convince me to do it… I have to fight it and say no so it goes back to sleep but it’s always drifting in the back of my mind, just in case. I can’t kill it, I don’t know how to make it go away completely, it’s always been there just sleeping and there are periods of time it wakes up more often than others…<br/>
I often feel like I’m just staying alive for other people. I don’t want to be alive but I force myself to be for the sake of all the pain I would cause others. I’ll stay alive for now for them, in hopes things will get better…<br/>
But when things get really hard I find comfort in knowing one day, I’ll take back control.. one day, I’ll escape all this pain.. one day, I’ll get revenge on my mind and the world for all the pain it’s caused me by killing myself. It has been built up in my mind all my life as a solution to my depression and ongoing problems and constant hurt and pain, I fantasize about it. But at the same time all the times I’ve gotten the closest to it, I feel scared and traumatized trying to fight it, like there really is a monster inside me that wants to kill me. I wake up the next day relieved that I didn’t do it, feeling almost silly and embarrassed by how extreme and drastic I was going to behave not realizing I could just stick it out another day and things could get better. I feel something simple like the warmth of the sun or see a smile of a child or hear a heartfelt song… and think, man I’m so glad I’m alive. Little moments like this are what life is all about, this is where joy is found. Or I start to feel inspiration on a deep level in my mind as I think about life and question my perception of things. I guess it’s the mood swings that get me. On any given day, during any given hour, I go through so many different intense emotions. All my thoughts feel like reality, I don’t know where they come from and I don’t know what’s real. I’m always trying to question my negative thoughts, I get exhausted from all the fighting. I just want stability and to get off this rollercoaster. I need to take life one day at a time. To live one day at a time. Or maybe one moment at a time. The more I stick it out the more I realize the only constant in life is change, as much as I may think things haven’t gotten better, if I really look back they have. I am happier and healthier now than I’ve ever been. In my low moments I need to look at the big picture. I didn’t get this far to quit. I’m getting better. I deserve to stick it out for myself. I owe it to myself. I’m not going out without a fight. I just need to keep fighting, and to ask for help when I need it. There’s nothing wrong with admitting I can’t fight this by myself.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>My brother was diagnosed with depression years before I was, and because of that he started therapy years before I did. </p>
<p>I still remember when I was a young teen and he was playing a Nirvana song and he stopped it at this one line: “I miss the comfort of being sad” </p>
<p>He told me that when you start to get better, there’s a part of you that misses being sad and that if you start feeling that way you have to be extra extra aware and careful because if you indulge the feeling you’ll go down a self-destructive spiral </p>
<p>And even though that was years and years ago, I think about it all the time. Especially when I’m reading discourse on the idea of getting so attached to mental illness as an identity that you don’t want to improve things because you feel safe in it and don’t know who you are without it</p>
<p>I always think of that line “I miss the comfort of being sad” and my brother’s warning </p>

They try to yell the depression out of you, push you towards stress to deal with anxiety, discipline the self hatred away, but all they do is suppress the visible symptoms with their aggression. The child becomes too scared to show it. So instead, the mental illness becomes quiet, you learn to hide it, or you might not even have control over showing symptoms at all. They don’t see it any longer, and they think it’s ‘solved’, but all it did was shatter you even more and isolate you in a world where you’re too afraid to reach out<br/></p></blockquote>

<p>sometimes you say or do bad things while you’re in an awful mental place. sometimes you say things that are rude or uncalled for or manipulative. and i’m not going to hold that against you. mental illness is hard, and no one is perfect. but once you’re through that episode, you need to take steps to make amends. you need to apologize.</p>
<p>“i couldn’t help it, i was having a bad episode” is a justification, not an apology.<br/></p>
<p>“i’m so fucking sorry, i fucked up, i don’t deserve to live, i should stop talking to anyone ever, i should die” is a second breakdown and a guilt trip. it is not an apology.<br/></p>
<p>when you apologize, the focus should be on the person you hurt. “i’m sorry. i did something that was hurtful to you. even if i was having a rough time, you didn’t deserve to hear that,” is a better apology. if it was a small thing, you can leave it at that.</p>
<p>if you caused significant distress to the other person, this is a good time to talk about how you can minimize damage in the future. and again, even if it is tempting to say you should self-isolate and/or die, that is not a helpful suggestion. it will result in the person you’re talking to trying to talk you out of doing that, which makes your guilt the focus of the conversation instead of their hurt.</p>
<p>you deserve friendship, and you deserve support. but a supportive friend is not an emotional punching bag, and mental illness does not absolve you of responsibility for your actions. what you say during a mental breakdown doesn’t define you. how you deal with the aftermath though, says a lot.</p>

<p>trauma doesn’t often feel like trauma is ‘supposed’ to feel. it feels like indifferent detachment, watching from outside yourself because nothing can hurt you there. it feels normal, just how people interact, so why are you making a big deal about it?  it feels like a joke – just how kids play, just how adults tease, just how some relationships work. </p>
<p>you wake from nightmares five years later and still wonder if you made it all up.</p>
<p>trauma can look like bad behaviour. like the stubborn refusal to get better, to stop self-destructing. trauma is putting yourself in harm’s way because you don’t really mean it, or because it’s funny, or because you just want to feel something, or because you just want to stop feeling. it’s wanting to destroy and reassemble yourself into another person entirely, so your real life can begin. because this isn’t real. because really bad things don’t happen to people like you.</p>
<p>trauma is the constant feeling of being an impostor. it’s the drive to survive twinned with the impulse to make yourself more sick in more ways. to hurt yourself to prove how bad you feel, or to punish yourself for exaggerating. you want people to believe what you’ve been through, to tell you your feelings are real, that your memories really happened. but when people do take you seriously, you play it off as a joke, apologize for bringing the mood down.</p>
<p>you go on and on about how it wasn’t that bad. you seek permission to still love the ones who hurt you, because it’s the people closest to us who can hurt us most deeply. </p>
<p>you can feel like the people who hurt you are the only ones who really knew you. in low self esteem, you can mistake cruelty for honesty. </p>
<p>there will always be people who have been through worse. that doesn’t make what happened to you okay. </p>
<p>there will always be people who don’t believe you. that doesn’t mean you are lying. </p>
<p>at some point, you have to take yourself seriously. you have to make a life you can stand to live. it’s the only way to survive.</p>

<p>i have never related to a post on tumblr during my 8 years in this website as much as i related to this one. it hurts because if other people feel exactly like this, what happened to me was also real and my pain is real. i just stopped and stared at the ceiling for 15 minutes. i hate how accurate this is. i hate how it hits home. i hate how i feel all of this.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h1>Check up on Your Friends</h1><p>Please, everyone, check on your strong friends. Check on all friends. In the wake of the two suicides that happened I am begging you. YOU reach out to them. They won’t reach out to you. Their dark thoughts have likely convinced them that you don’t care, so prove to them that you do. Talk to them in private and don’t make a scene out of it. Let them talk and tell you what’s wrong without the fear of judgement or being institutionalized.</p><p>PLEASE only call police if your friend is showing major signs of suicide or self harm. As someone who had campus police called on her because I took a walk at night to calm my depression (while on the phone with someone telling them where I was so they understood I was safe), it makes the person lose trust in everyone involved. Use your best judgement in the scenario before calling police. Police should be called if the person is a major threat to themselves and is showing or acting as if they have every intention of suicide or self harm.</p><p>I suffer from depression. I’m very open about it. I’m open about the fact that I’m 2 years clean of cutting. I’m open about my suicidal ideation when my depression gets bad. The problem is that people think I’m fine now, but I still have horrible nights like tonight. One small thing can send me into a depressive episode. Yet no one has asked me how I’ve been coping in months. Even my friends who are posting the suicide hotline and all the viral posts haven’t asked me if I’m ok. It’s as if they forgot.</p><p>Check on your friends. Im the strong friend. I’m the mom friend. I make plans and try to make people laugh, but I’ve been sucidal many times and would have killed myself if not for my boyfriend or friends having decent timing. </p><p>Please, check on them. As the late, great Robin Williams said “I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.” 💜</p></blockquote>

up to the point where you don’t even have confidence Or believe you can find someone to make you happy I wonder if you know,
how exactly you have broken me
How I look in the mirror and think,
I am not good enough. I stare at myself and truly believe
no one will ever love me at least not as much as I love them,
because I give too much and that is just exhausting. I get anxiety all the time,
at the thought of you At the thought of ever loving someone
The way I loved you. Of getting attached because I fear they will all become you,
constantly disappointing me. I don’t have confidence anymore,
I can’t even talk to someone else
because I don’t think anything I say will be good enough
But I am fucking good enough You just made me feel that I could never be. I’m afraid of the world because of you,
Of people like you That act so selfishly and call it, “Making myself better” When in reality You’re a shitty indecisive person That cannot let go of the one person Who gave you everything
And you realize a little too late,
they are all you’ve ever wanted. But guess what,
I’ve know that for a long time. I’ve known you were all I ever wanted,
the sad part is You changed. You are not the person I fell in love with. And I’m not the person you feel in love with I am the person you destroyed but I will also be the person that will find happiness,
without you.”</blockquote> <p>— -basically word vomit</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h1>Why You Will Never Forget The Signs:</h1><p><i>(And why you shouldn’t).</i></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Aries</b>: With them everything was easy. They had a strong, impulsive personality; one that made them look as someone who wasn’t afraid of anyone nor anything. They were honest and caring, and above all, they were always by your side no matter what. It’s normal to never forget an Aries… they were too special.</p><p><b>Taurus: </b>They were too attentive. They didn’t give you everything at every hour, but when you least expected they appeared with that thing you were waiting for during weeks. Even when they were sad, they made you smile. And y<i>es,</i> you miss them.<br/><br/><b>Gemini:</b> Every time you took a look on Gemini, you had one thing clear: t<i>hey were one of the most expressive people you knew. </i>They texted you just to know if you were doing ok, if you had arrived your home safe and to tell you that they missed you. They seemed to know exactly how you felt. They cared too much about you, and they weren’t even afraid to show it. Y<strike>ou should call them.</strike><br/><br/><b>Cancer:</b> They were kind of complicated, especially with those mood swings… But when you discovered that they just needed love, you realized how amazing they were. They were the one who waited for you in the night, the one who texted you a million times just to tell you they were thinking about you, the one who looked for you everywhere because they wanted a hug. Maybe you don’t remember exactly when they left, but you do remember all the times they made you feel complete.<br/><br/><b>Leo:</b> They’re just too hard to forget. Leo spent time with you, Leo made you feel soft, warm, loved. L<i>eo was magic. L</i>eo was the Sun, because when they left, it suddenly felt cold and dark. Everything changed. You told yourself you’re doing okay, but it’s not true. You can’t forget them because your life it’s not the same without them. <br/><br/><b>Virgo:</b> You tried to find somebody like them, but you didn’t success. Virgo could listen to you talking about the same topic for hours and hours, and they wouldn’t complain. They didn’t tell you ‘i love you’, but they made you feel loved. Virgo was different, and, at the same time, Virgo was just like you. <br/><br/><b>Libra:</b> They weren’t afraid to tell you how they felt and that they’d missed you, even when it wasn’t convenient for them. Libra believed in love, friendship, and everything pure in this world. And you admired them for that. It’s okay if you can’t forget them; nobody could.<br/><br/><b>Scorpio:</b> They gave everything for you. They were there for you when nobody else was, they held you when you were falling apart, they told you not what you wanted to hear – but the truth, and now you realize that that’s what you really needed back then. They supported you, and now that they’re gone you feel as if they had left a hole in you. Well, … maybe you should speak to them again.<br/><br/><b>Sagittarius:</b> You will never forget the excitement you felt when talking to them on the phone in the late, late night. Their laugh, their jokes, their stories. You will never forget them because they made you feel. You miss their energy and how they smiled when they spoke. <br/><br/><b>Capricorn:</b> They had strength, they had bravery, they had character. Beside them, you learnt how to be mature, how to be a better person; to understand life. Perhaps it’s true that you didn’t miss them at first, but now they’re the only thing you can think about. Stop waiting for a sign. Call them.<br/><br/><b>Aquarius:</b> It is quite complicated to forget someone who always tries to make everyone happy, someone who made you feel free and gave you all their love and trust, and that, my friend, is your case. You felt safe and sound next to them, and you learnt how to enjoy the littlest things in life. <br/><br/><b>Pisces:</b> You will remember their generosity, their kindness, their patience towards others. Pisces was too special for you, because you always had that strange feeling of freshness with them. Probably they were your favorite person in the world. Maybe you won’t forget them in the near future, and maybe you shouldn’t try to.</p></blockquote>

<p>actually wait i’m not done bc i just realised that the fact that i had no choice but to force my body beyond its limits pretty much every single day for a period of several years during a crucial stage of my development in order to maintain a balanced work/social life is literally the reason why i’m now so ill and depressed that getting out of bed every morning is a herculean task all on its own. the expectations placed on me and millions of others during our teenage years is literally making us sick.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>ok not to sound like a preacher but before I entered the radfem community I was SO MUCH more insecure. I literally couldn’t even talk to my family without make up on, I was so insecure about my face. Now, I’m seeing myself grow. I’m seeing myself without makeup and, instead of cringing, seeing love and beauty within myself. Men are allowed to be seen as attractive and love themselves no matter what they look like, and I’m bringing myself to a point where I don’t need to make myself look like a Barbie doll to feel ok. In fact, I think I’m starting to feel better about myself when I’m NOT wearing makeup, which is a huge step, considering I’ve been caking my face since I was 8 years old and using my mom’s too-dark foundation. I still wear make up on most days, but when I get home, or know I’m not doing anything, I feel comfortable without it. I know his sounds like nothing, but I’m just so grateful for this community helping me grow. If ever any of you want to talk about make up culture, your insecurities, or anything at all, my asks and messages r always open :) </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>
<p>A child being raised by a parent or caregiver who is suffering from alcohol abuse may have a variety of conflicting emotions that need to be addressed in order to avoid future problems. They are in a difficult position because they cannot go to their own parents for support. Some of the feelings can include the following:</p>
<ul><li><u>Guilt</u>. The child may see himself or herself as the main cause of the mother’s or father’s drinking.</li>
<li><u>Anxiety</u>.  The child may worry constantly about the situation at home.  He or she may fear the alcoholic parent will become sick or injured, and may also fear fights and violence between the parents.</li>
<li><u>Embarrassment</u>.  Parents may give the child the message that there is a terrible secret at home.  The ashamed child does not invite friends home and is afraid to ask anyone for help.</li>
<li><u>Inability to have close relationships</u>.  Because the child has been disappointed by the drinking parent many times, he or she often does not trust others.</li>
<li><u>Confusion</u>.  The alcoholic parent will change suddenly from being loving to angry, regardless of the child’s behavior.  A  regular daily schedule, which is very important for a child, does not exist because bedtimes and mealtimes are constantly changing.</li>
<li><u>Anger</u>.  The child feels anger at the alcoholic parent for drinking, and may be angry at the non-alcoholic parent for lack of support and protection.</li>
<li><u>Depression</u>.  The child feels lonely and helpless to change the situation.</li>
</ul><p>Although the child tries to keep the alcoholism a secret, teachers, relatives, other adults, or friends may sense that something is wrong.  Teachers and caregivers should be aware that the following behaviors may signal a drinking or other problem at home:</p>
<ul><li>Failure in school; truancy</li>
<li>Lack of friends; withdrawal from classmates</li>
<li>Delinquent behavior, such as stealing or violence</li>
<li>Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches</li>
<li>Abuse of drugs or alcohol; or</li>
<li>Aggression towards other children</li>
<li>Risk taking behaviors</li>
<li>Depression or suicidal thoughts or behavior</li>
</ul><p>Some children of alcoholics may cope by taking the role of responsible “parents” within the family and among friends.  They may become controlled, successful “overachievers” throughout school, and at the same time be emotionally isolated from other children and teachers.  Their emotional problems may show only when they become adults.</p>

<blockquote><p>nobody wants to admit that ADD/ADHD is a serious mental illness that can be literally debilitating because it’s always painted as not as serious as depression or whatever, but people with ADHD that takes over their whole life, people who can’t focus to save their lives, people who get overwhelmed by two people talking, people who randomly burst into tears with sensory overload, and people who can’t go five minutes without their ADHD being a dick exist and are real and valid. their mental illness is valid. ADHD is a mental illness just as real and valid as depression or anxiety. it’s not “omg i’m so adhd and random x3”. it’s a mental illness that often requires serious medication, therapy, and behavioral exercises.  stop brushing adhd under the rug in favor of fetishizing sadness &amp; depression Thanks.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Food is just food and doesn’t have a natural mealtime. This is especially important to remember when you’re dealing with mental illness that makes it hard to eat.</p>
<p>When I’m in a down swing with my depression, I forget to eat/don’t feel like eating. When I do get around to eating, often the only thing I want is something like pancakes, or milk, or apple sauce. And of course it’s 6pm and I feel lame for eating ‘breakfast’ foods. Or it’s 8am and I want fried chicken, and feel like a terrible person for eating dinner at 8 in the morning.</p>
<p>But food is just food. We assign certain foods to certain times of day culturally, but it’s not a biological thing. Your body can digest pizza at 9 in the morning and yogurt at 11pm. Are you eating food? Yes? Then great! It doesn’t matter what ‘kind’ of food you’re eating, as long as you’re nourishing that body of yours. It’s ok to have cheap ramen for breakfast if that’s all you can stand to eat. That’s ok–you ate food today!! That’s a major accomplishment when you’re dealing with an illness that tries to stop you from doing everyday person things. (Especially if you’re recovering from an eating disorder.)</p>
<p>Don’t feel bad if you eat rice for breakfast or muffins for dinner. Food is just food.</p>

Wishing for a way out that does not require me to take my own life because I can not bare the thought of my mother sobbing at my casket thinking she could have stopped this. There will be days that I want to die, but I need you to know that there will also be days where I want to live. I will day dream about my future and have just a small bit of hope. I will imagine what i’ll be doing 10 years from now. Where my life will have taken me. My mind is inconsistent and will switch from suicide to living day after day. But I will be okay, because even when the world seems meaningless and gray, I know that maybe one day this feeling will pass. </p></blockquote>

<p>By all means, talk and raise awareness about depression. But please mention: </p>
<p>•Not showering or brushing your teeth for two weeks<br/>
•Getting sick from a vitamin D deficiency because you haven’t been outside in a solid month<br/>
•Getting lightheaded when you stand up from bed because you’ve been laying down for days<br/>
•The body pains <br/>
•Shampoo not bubbling because this is the first time you washed your hair in three weeks<br/>
•Over stimulation<br/>
•Pity from a distance<br/>
•'Get over yourself, there’s people *in Africa starving, with cancer, homeless, living in poverty, dying, ect.’<br/>
•Massive weight gain<br/>
•Massive weight loss<br/>
•Both<br/>
•Your body literally changing how it looks and deposits fat based on frequent weight gain and loss<br/>
•Hair loss <br/>
•Zero self esteem <br/>
•Breaking out in acne so bad you can’t put your head on a pillow from pain <br/>
•Being too depressed to commit suicide<br/>
•Self imposed isolation <br/>
•Stomach cramps<br/>
•Nausea<br/>
•Vomiting <br/>
•'You’re so dramatic, it can’t be that bad’</p>
<p>If you don’t, I’m not saying you’re not raising awareness, but you definitely need to reevaluate your platform </p>

<p>Depression is super hard to deal with. I 100% support this list because I feel some people think depression is writing sad poems and that’s its. </p>
<p>Depression looks different on everyone, some hide pretty well and some don’t.  </p>
<p>Remember to be kind to yourself and please do not make any rash decisions because you are ill. </p>
<p>Remember to be kind to others. You never know what people are going through. </p>

<p>i understand when ur 13 and u just realized u have a mental illness and ur so relieved to know there are other ppl going thru the same thing as u, its easy to slip into the idea that your newly labeled thoughts and behaviors are normal and okay.</p>
<p>they are not. suicidal thoughts arent normal. violent impulses arent normal. delusions and hallucinations arent normal.</p>
<p>now that you have a name for this behavior you need to seek help. dont let tumblr trick you into thinking unhealthy coping mechanisms are the only ways to deal with your mental illness. dont let it fester, dont let it worsen. seek as much help as you can. actively try to better yourself.</p>

<blockquote><p>nobody ever talks about how selfless it is to choose, over and over again, to not commit suicide. nobody ever acknowledges the tremendous sacrifice suicidal people make every time we choose not to kill ourselves. when a person who is suffering so horribly that death seems like their best option decides not to take their one way out, and to instead remain in hell, day after day, year after year, because they don’t want to hurt the people they love, they are doing something extraordinary. not killing yourself when it’s all you want to do is the purest act of love i can imagine. dying for someone is easy – you don’t have to deal with any of the consequences, you have your moment of nobility and then it’s all over. but living for someone, when the simple fact of consciousness is literal torture for you? every single suicidal person who ever made a choice to not kill themselves in a moment of misery is a goddamn hero in my eyes. wanting to die and still surviving is an act of titanic courage and self-sacrifice. we deserve more credit for it.</p></blockquote>

If you feel like you can’t make it through the next few minutes, take it one breath at a time.” I have to remind myself that, you’re gonna be okay, try to see through the cloud of doubt that is harboring all of the negative energy. It’s gonna get better. You are not alone. You are loved. So many people care about you, and want to see you happy and smiley. It’s okay to feel like this. Your feelings are valid.

I don’t want to be told I’m lucky they didn’t. I don’t want abuse to be painted as a “challenge” I happened to survive. I didn’t stay alive by my skills, I didn’t want to participate in abuse. It’s not a part of life. </p><p>Victim it is more accurate, because if you’re victimized it means there’s a perpetrator. Victim describes that everything that happened was out of your control, and people feel extremely uncomfortable about that, but it is the reality, and it takes responsibility off of your shoulders. You went thru things beyond your control. It harmed you way beyond you would allow something to harm you. You had no protection against a person who tortured you. This person has shown they’re a monster, and they need to be stopped from hurting you, or anyone else again. That’s what the word “victim” stands for. </p><p>Nobody chooses or has control over weather they’re victimized, and when it does happen, only humane thing to do is to stand with the victim and fight against the monster. And surviving monsters should never be painted as a challenge. Nobody should even have to face one. They should be gone from the environment. They don’t serve any purpose. They’re not a part of human life. They’re predators who have no business calling themselves humans. They should be banished and eliminated. We shouldn’t have to survive this. </p></blockquote>

<p>i say this as things i would like to tell other people who are dating someone with borderline personality disorder. i personally have it and have only had it for about a year, but i have also had a boyfriend for over a year and these are things that i tell him and i thought it would be useful.</p>
<p>1) borderlines want attention. they want to be loved. they want to know that someone cares about them. we often fear abandonment and it gives us a lot of anxiety and often causes depressive episodes. remind your partner that you love and care about them</p>
<p>2) borderlines feel emotion about 5 times stronger than someone without this disorder. do not tell us that we are over reacting to something that happened, instead comfort us</p>
<p>3) we never purposefully mean to be abusive or hurt you. you are never forced to stay with us. the reason we may behave in a way that makes you feel like you have to take care of us is because of intense fear of abandonment.</p>
<p>4) sometimes we are impulsive, and it’s best to try to help control us with that. this can mean excessive spending, dangerous behavior, etc, and the best thing you can do is to try to promote us to stop doing it. i would wish that people would help bring me back into reality when i’m being impulsive. </p>
<p>5) our mood can be very unstable, so don’t be surprised when we’re suddenly breaking down or depressive. try to be comforting when this is happening</p>

<p>there’s not really much discussion of child neglect on here so i guess i have to do it</p>
<p>p l e a s e don’t shame neglect survivors for not knowing “basic” things like how to eat a balanced diet, when to go to the doctor, how to drive, etc. you know these things (usually) because a caring adult taught them to you. <i>we didn’t have that.</i> we often enter adulthood knowing jack shit about how to take care of ourselves. we <i>know</i> we’re missing information, and we feel so fucking lost.</p>
<p>it’s okay to, if you have a friend who’s experienced neglect, try and help them learn how to take care of themselves. saying things like “hey, do you think you could try to eat at least one vegetable per day?” or “that infection looks pretty bad, do you want to go to a doctor?” is genuinely helpful. but belittling us for not already knowing these things is completely unproductive and unnecessarily cruel.</p>

<blockquote><p>Growing up in an
abusive family means you always have to be strong. Sometimes they’ll even tell
you, that it’s okay what they’re doing to you, because you’re strong, you can
take it. You don’t get hurt by that much. You can’t allow yourself to be weak, because
after all, everyone is relying on you to be strong.</p><p>You can’t show
their insults or beatings or humiliation are getting to you, because if you do,
it means you’re weak. You can’t allow yourself to get traumatized, because if
you do get traumatized, it means you’re weak. You should be strong enough to
take it. You always have to be strong enough to take whatever they throw at
you. That’s what you’re all about, being strong, swallowing abuse, not letting
it get to you, not allowing anyone to see just how far it got to you.</p><p>And then, if
everyone expects you to be okay and demands you to act normal, it must be your
fault, right? Because you kept pretending to be okay, so now how would they
know that you’re not? So it’s not their fault anymore, it was you who pretended
to be strong, you who failed to be strong, and you who is to blame for every
bit of pain, dread, fear and grief flooding every bit of you.</p><p>Believe me, they
know what they’re doing. A child can’t act that well, and there is nobody in
the world stupid enough to believe that continuous insults, abuse, hatred and
blows wouldn’t have a horrible impact on a child. They’re playing dumb. They
know you’re in pain, that you’re hurt, and they want you to be, and they want
to continue hurting you. They don’t want to feel responsible or guilty about
it, so it’s convenient for them if you believe it’s your fault, if you believe
that falling victim to their abuse would make you weak. This isn’t about
strenght anymore. You can’t not be traumatized by people who are supposed to be
your family throwing abuse and hatred at you. Nobody can. That’s just being a
human being. There is no escape from trauma once your family betrays you and
uses you as their punching bag, when they were supposed to nurture and cherish you,
like someone they care about growing up healthy and happy. </p><p>Now your family,
those are the true weaklings. Can you imagine grownup people relying on a small
child to be strong for them, to endure what they don’t want to endure, to
swallow their abuse so they wouldn’t feel bad? That’s weak. They were supposed
to be strong and lend you strength, not act like you’re some punching bag whose
only purpose is to make them feel better. You were supposed to be allowed to be
weak. To rely on them. Being allowed to be weak sometimes, in long term makes
you stronger. Because if you have to use up all of your strength as a child, it
comes with a too great of a price. This strength doesn’t grow, but gets used
up, exhausted, pushed to the limit, until you’re finally broken. It makes you
weaker and weaker, and no matter what anyone says about abuse “making you
strong”, that’s not what it does. It uses up your life’s strength instead.
The strength you were supposed to have, to build boundaries, to protect yourself
from abuse, to feel confident and like you belong, to feel your own value.. it
corrodes all of them. True strength is drawn from community, from nurturing,
from belonging and being cared for. Abused children are left without all of
this, and have to live on their survival strength, meaning they have to use up
their life energy just to stay alive.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>“Not long ago, a question bubbled to the surface of my brain: if my body could speak, would she forgive me? Though it sounds strange, it was wildly helpful for me to start thinking of my body as a being separated from myself. This mindset made it easier for me to be gentle and more forgiving with my body, because we are sadly often more willing to be unkind to ourselves than we are to someone else. I began to experience newfound guilt for putting my body through the abuse of my eating disorder, because what did my poor, loyal body do to deserve such violence? The answer is nothing, and the same is true for you, too: your sweet body did nothing to deserve to endure the wrath of you.”</blockquote> <p>— Blythe Baird, “<a href="https://twloha.com/blog/tips-that-helped-me-in-eating-disorder-recovery/">Tips That Helped Me in Eating Disorder Recovery</a>”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As the year draws to a close I am reminded of a singular truth.</p><p><b>It takes a lot of strength, determination, and resilience to survive child abuse.</b></p><p>It takes what one would think is a cosmic event just to sustain oneself through abusive parenting, to persevere in the midst of scapegoating, name-calling, and threatened or actual physical violence, to endure in the face of cruelty. But it wasn’t a planetary alignment or a shooting star. It was you. It was you holding yourself together, gripping onto your body and soul.<b> It was you.</b></p><p>So let’s hear it for all the survivors of child abuse, the ones who expected love and safety from their roots and instead found themselves stuck in a terrifying and isolating situation.</p><p>This is to all of us who have been physically harmed, beaten, assaulted, hurt. </p><p>This is to all of us who have been threatened, screamed at, insulted, humiliated, shamed.</p><p>This is to all of us who have been neglected, abandoned, left to wither, ignored.</p><p>This is to all of us who were wrongfully punished.</p><p>This is to all of us who learned early on that it can hurt to be a child. </p><p>This is to all of us who had to face bullying at school then go home only to get bullied some more. </p><p>This is to all of us who witnessed horrible things and felt helpless. </p><p>This is to all of us who always had to fight for our stability or learn how to create it.</p><p>This is to all of us who had to raise ourselves, teach ourselves morals, right from wrong. </p><p>This is to all of us who feel like we lost something or had something stolen from us.</p><p>Something irreplaceable.</p><p>This is to all of us who had to learn to be our own heroes. </p><p>This is to all of us who are now spending years dismantling internalized abuse after we’ve escaped or it simply stopped. <br/></p><p>This is to all of us who are trying to recover and to end the cycle of abuse.</p><p>We’re still here. We’re still fighting.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>And may those who we have lost along the way rest in power. </p><p>You are not forgotten. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>“when you are sad, don’t shave your legs. don’t go near the razor. when you are sad and your friend invites you out for coffee- wipe up your mascara and force yourself to go. you’ll cry less with a london fog in your hands. when you are sad and it’s late- go to sleep. everything seems worse at night. when the boy who was chugging the vodka an hour ago asks if you need a ride home- say no. take his keys. do not let him drive. if he tries to drive- call the police. if people start getting drugged- call the police. if people start getting assaulted- call the police. it doesn’t matter if the party gets shut down early. when the boy who makes rape jokes, asks you out to dinner- say no. loudly. so he can’t pretend that he didn’t hear it. when your best friend tells you that she doesn’t want to be friends anymore- don’t apologize to her. pack your boxes with steady hands. move back home to your parents. they’ve missed you so much. when the doctor asks how many sexual partners you have had- answer honestly. she is not judging you. the number will not turn the walls to blood. stop judging yourself. when you find a drunk girl passed out on the couch at the party- check for her pulse. help her to the bathroom. feed her water. hiss at any boys that try to touch her… you would’ve wanted someone to do the same for you. when your first love tells you that he has cheated on you- leave him. don’t wait for it to happen 3 more times. don’t punch a hole in the wall, you’ll wait all night in the ER before a doctor will see you. when he tries to win you back, remember the vows you made to yourself after he left the first time. remember the baptism of self love that you had to force yourself to dunk under. buying you flowers doesn’t make him a saint.”</blockquote> <p>— advice for my 13 year old self // things i wish i knew then</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I think we should
be rescuing children from abuse and not waiting for them to grow up and somehow
get out on their own. It would change their lives so much if someone out there
thought they were worthy of saving and being taken care of. I spent most of my
childhood dreaming about someone, anyone declaring I can go with them and no
longer have to go back to my parent’s house, it was the strongest wish I had. I
felt like even if one person really cared for me, that would be rescue enough,
it would give me enough support to survive and not lose my sanity. It took me
so much to accept that nobody, not on person in the world thought I was worth
saving, or that anyone should help me. Now it’s too late, I used up my life
energy to get myself out and it’s pretty much over with my trust into the
world, I hate everyone and don’t want anything to do with entire society. This
could have been prevented by even one person helping me out and making sure I
was okay and safe but that never happened. Do you know how hard it is to save
yourself when no human on this earth believes you worthy of saving? It’s shit
and I don’t like it. I don’t like the way this society functions at all. If I
had resources I would go and take all abused children and offer them a place to
stay at least. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. <br/></p>
<p>BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just <i>decide</i> you have it, just like you don’t <i>decide</i> you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t <i>decide</i> you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t <i>want</i> it.</p>
<p>BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.</p>
<p>It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite <i>there</i>. Ever.</p>
<p>It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. </p>
<p>It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”</p>
<p>It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative. </p>

<blockquote><p>Abusive parents
go on and on about how their children’s behaviour reflects on them and how much
children need to behave in order to cast a good light on the parents but you
know what you never hear about? How parents’ behaviour reflects on kids. There
is not one abused kid who isn’t fucked up about weather they’ll end up like
their parents, and if people will assume they’re the same as their parents. What’s
even worse, abusive parents usually make themselves more important than their
children, and teach others to dismiss or ignore the child, can you imagine
living like that? Having not only your parents, but other people act like your
wants and opinions and desires are only secondary to what your parents think of
you and want for you? People acting like since you’re a child of that specific
people, you should hand over all your desires and opinions and be obedient and
belong to your parents as their property? That you have no right to a voice of
your own?</p><p>That is the real
fucking nightmare, abusive parents casting a black shadow cast over your entire
person and turning society against you, just to preserve their status. Nobody
wants to be that. Children have to work so hard to prove that they’re
different, to clear their social image, to show everyone that they have actual
value, that their parents have been lying entire time. This is something
abusive parents never have to go thru, and I’m sick and tired of them playing
the victim when they’re the offenders. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Stop romanticising mental illnesses or disorders because there is nothing nice bout them <br/>
Depression isnt a sad girl crying nd  a boy hugging her and staying he will love her forever , its a girl crying or not even crying , not even feeling anything and just wishing she would die .<br/>
Bulimia isnt a pretty girl with long her vomiting over the toilet and a boy holding her hair saying he love her no matter what and tucking her to bed<br/>
Its  bending over the toilet with bloodshot eyes , fingers down her throughts and an empty stomach .<br/>
Self harm isnt a girl with cuts and a boy telling her that her cuts look beautiful nd kissing thm .<br/>
Its holding a razor at night and cutting your skin with bloody hands and wishing to get the courage to evenpress it further so u would end it all .its a burden that u alays carry around ith u.uts having friends running away from u and looking at u like ur from another planet .<br/>
Bipolar disorder int being just happy because you got a new phone or sad because you got a b on a test .<br/>
Its madness , its feeling suicidal for months and feeling high for others .<br/>
And there is much more than that <br/>
SO STOP ROMANTICISING THE BECAUSE THE ARE AWEFUL , THE DESTRUCT YOU AND RUIN YOUR LIFE .</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><h1>Cutting</h1><p>Some people still see cutting as cool. It’s not.  </p><p><b>what cutting is</b>: It’s feeling the sting when water runs over your cuts. It’s the fabric of your clothes rubbing up against them. It’s cleaning them to make sure they don’t get infected. It’s keeping them hidden at all times. It’s wearing long sleeves even when it’s hot outside. It’s not wanting to wear a swim suit because of your scars or healing cuts. It’s putting make up on them trying to make them disappear when you have to be uncovered. It’s hiding cuts with bracelets. It’s being very careful out in public to make sure your scars or cuts don’t show. It’s saying you’re clean when someone asks you if you are. Even if you’re not. Including doctors and therapists. It’s the pain that comes with every movement. It’s hating yourself for ever starting to self harm. It’s not wanting to stop. It’s being asked questions about your scars or cuts if they get seen. It’s being confronted by people when they find out. It’s the disappointment you feel after you do it and when people find out. It’s living in constant fear that someone might see your cuts or scars. It’s saying “the cat did it” when someone finds out. It’s wanting to cut for every little thing you do wrong. Its relapsing after being clean for almost a year. It’s an addiction. </p><p><b>what cutting is <i>NOT: </i></b>beautiful, pretty, romantic, cool, poetic, or a fad. </p><p>bottom line,</p><p><b>CUTTING</b> <b>IS DANGEROUS AND AN ADDICTION AND IT’S <i>NOT </i>PRETTY !! </b></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>One thing that really fucked me up growing up in an abusive household is when my friends would come over and they’d be like, “Omg your mom and dad are so nice/awesome/cool! Blah blah blah”… when in reality my parents were just on their best behavior. Most people don’t realize how much abuse kids go through because most people don’t know what signs to look out for when it comes to emotional/mental abuse. The wounds are in their minds and hearts so their pain is invisible to others. This makes it so hard for kids to speak up about their abusive homelives because a lot of people will brush it under the carpet to keep up appearances and or they won’t believe the victim and they’ll say that the victim is lying when in reality those kids are desperately reaching out for help and they just completely invalidated all of their pain and trauma. </p></blockquote>

It’s a totally different way of living and it impacts you long after you’ve left the situation.</p></blockquote>

<p>ok im gonna reblog this again bc i want more ppl to see it?? ive compiled a (by no means complete) list of the things u can expect if u start:</p>
<p>- u cant stop. its a legitimate addiction. there is no ‘seeing what its like’. its soso hard to stop it and believe me, because that was me. i thought i would sate my curiosity but all i did was make my life miserable<br/>- everything can become a trigger. someone carved things in a table?? trigger. u get a scratch by accident?? trigger. see something sharp?? yup. <br/>- the scars dont go away and if people see them (and no matter how hard you try, people will see them) they get this awful fucking look on their face like a mixture of disgust and horror and pity <br/>- u have to sit through people making shitty fucking jokes and calling people like you (real, struggling people like <i>you</i>) edgy emos looking for attention and it makes you feel sick but you have to sit there silently<br/>- in fact, any conversation about self harm becomes thoroughly uncomfortable because they’ll talk about it like no one in the room has ever gone through it (or, if they know, they’ll glance at you out the corner of their eye when they think you cant see)<br/>- any emotion can give you the urges- not just negative. ur body associates the happy feeling with the pain so ur brain is like ‘????? u cant have one without the other??’ <br/>- it can have been years. <i>years.</i> you can have stopped and got better and you’ll still feel the urge to hurt yourself and it makes you feel like you haven’t improved at all and you’re still fourteen and hating yourself<br/>- (maybe this is just me) but some part of you misses it?? you stopped and you know its horrific but its so difficult to get rid of your blades or whatever you use because you feel so weirdly attached to these things that are so awful and you dont even know <i>why </i></p>
<p>god damn i just want yall to understand that you dont have to hurt yourself ever, okay?? just. don’t. trust me.</p>

years old when i first cut myself. i sat silently through so many emo 
jokes, told by people i considered friends. i went through the pain that
 drove me to cut at eleven years old, and then on top of that there were
 all these signs that i couldn’t open up to people i cared about. that 
they’d think it was funny. i’d already had far too much of people 
thinking i was funny. and i didn’t simply grow out of it. im 24 years 
old now and i have trouble showing my arms in front of my own family. i 
haven’t hurt myself in over two months. that’s an achievement at this 
stage. and i still have cravings. i have them right now. 
<p>it’s really fucking hard and look i get that not everyone is gonna understand, but you can still respect things you don’t understand<br/></p></blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recovery feels strange because for so long you got used to the loudness. The presence of the intense pain was almost something you could rely on to be there when everything else was so uncertain. The pain was in itself a coping mechanism. <i>Do this so you don’t have to deal with that. </i></p>
<p>Everyone always says it gets better. But the truth is sometimes your situation doesn’t change, you do. And so when the pain begins to ease there’s a quiet that is so difficult to become accustomed to. And yet you know this is what you need, it is what you must try and fall in love with to replace your mind’s attraction to destruction. You must come round to the fact that life is at times mind numbingly boring, it is at times exhilarating and yet you must keep faith that one day will life will be more appealing than illness.</p>

<blockquote><h1>Things you should know before falling in love with me: </h1><p>1. I have a hard time opening my self up to people, and in the past, it’s ruined relationships for me. </p><p>2. I’m not a morning person at all, it’s best if you keep your distance until I’m completely awake.  </p><p>3. I am honest but I know at times I can be too honest and it’s never my intention to hurt your feelings, I just don’t think before I say things. </p><p>4. There are days when it’s just too much to get out of bed, and on days like those just know it’s not you, it’s never because of you. </p><p>5. I have so much love to give but I don’t know how. </p><p>6. I can get angry very quick and it can last for the whole day. And even if you weren’t the cause for my anger, stay away. You can’t reason with me when I’m like that. </p><p>7. I never want you to think I need you. I don’t, I can do all of this alone and be perfectly fine. </p><p>8. I’m not your property I am my own person and if you ever think you can cage me up, you’ve never been more wrong in your life. </p><p>9. Im a free Spirit and Love doing things that excite my soul. So be ready to go out of your comfort zone. </p><p>10. I sing in the car and you should too. </p><p>11. I’m a movie fanatic, I like anything that can make me feel something. </p><p>12. I can be the warmest person you’ve ever met, or I can be the coldest. It all depends on the type of person you are. </p><p>13. I feel things deeper than most and that’s why my emotions are always under lock and key. </p><p>14.  If I ever lose the fire in my eyes, don’t leave, just take me to bed and turn off all the lights, I’m just in my head, and that’s a place you never want to see. </p><p>15. I have a dark soul that sometimes makes me view the glass at half empty instead of half full. </p><p>16. I’ll never give you a reason to cheat on me. And if you do, you should just pack your shit and go. No explanation just leave. </p><p>17. I have many sides to me, each one being more complex than the last. But just know, no ones stayed long enough to see them all. </p><p>18. If you do leave because I’m something you can’t handle. I won’t be mad or hurt. Like i said before, I don’t need you. </p><p>19. If you ever see me cry, don’t say anything just pick me up and hold me. </p><p>20. I am not something you can fix and mold into something else. If you come into my life thinking that, you’re going to leave worse off than me. </p><p>21. I don’t like beating around the bush. It takes too much time. </p><p>22. I get hot very easily and when I am hot I’m a ticking time bomb that you don’t want to see blow. </p><p>23. Don’t put your hand on my throat if you don’t want what comes after. </p><p>24. When I’m on my period I can be very unpredictable and I’m sorry for whatever happens. </p><p>25. I know I come off as very independent and if that intimidates you then you should walk away now. </p><p>26. I’m looking for someone who will challenge me, someone who has the same goals as me and will do whatever to reach them. Someone who I can take on the world with. </p><p>27. I lose interest very easily and if you can’t keep me on my toes then we won’t last long at all. </p><p>28. I never ask for help but I won’t say no if you give it. It’s my pride and it’s a bitch. </p><p>29. Your happiness is key to me. And mine should be the same to you. </p><p>30. There is never a reason to lie to me, I’m very understanding. I take trust very seriously and if you lie to me all my trust for you is gone. </p><p>I know I am complicated and have a lot of layers to me, but believe me when I say, whoever gets past my walls and gets me, they’re the luckiest person because I have a lot to give.  </p><h1>— (k.L.k) </h1></blockquote>

<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://djenterrific.tumblr.com/post/129786060261">djenterrific</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. <br/></p>
<p>BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just <i>decide</i> you have it, just like you don’t <i>decide</i> you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t <i>decide</i> you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t <i>want</i> it.</p>
<p>BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.</p>
<p>It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite <i>there</i>. Ever.</p>
<p>It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. </p>
<p>It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”</p>
<p>It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative. </p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve ever found a post so perfectly descriptive. Thank you.</p>

Body: <p>Fridays used to make me so happy… I used to look forward to weekends and feel an excitement about all the things I would do on my two days of freedom. I would feel relief. Now, nothing really excites me. I feel as if I’m made of paper. Parchment paper… see through and fragile. Or like thin glass, one blow from shattering into dust. I feel exposed, my heart visible to the whole world, vulnerable and pathetic. I’m sad and closed off, I don’t want anyone coming too close or I might crumple up into a little ball, kicked around on the floor. My glass edges might cut anyone who comes near. I don’t want to talk to anyone because I really don’t have anything to say. Loneliness is not romantic. It’s not dreamy to be off by yourself, longing for the day someone will finally see you for who you really are. Because they won’t. No one is coming, no one sees you, no one cares.</p>

Body: <p>I prefer when people show me love through small gestures, that’s why I do it too, making them a cup of coffee in morning when they’re late for work or offering them my jacket when they forget theirs at home, texting them at random times during the day to make sure they’re alive, breathing okay, drank 8 glasses of water and eaten well, just listening to them no I mean really listening to them to know how they really are, reading their favourite books so I can talk about it with them, so I can see them get excited, even though I hate their favourite books and they bore me, staying up late at night to talk to them and help them with their homework so they don’t hand it in late and get in trouble, making dinner for them when they don’t feel well, I like to tell them of all the things that remind me of them because almost everything reminds me of them, the sky, the sea and the mountains, everything comes back to them, I love paying attention to them and knowing the little things, soft love is small gestures </p>
